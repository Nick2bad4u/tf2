# TF2 Autoexec Configuration

This autoexec configuration file for Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is designed to optimize FPS, network settings, volume, keybinds, and other miscellaneous settings for an improved gameplay experience.

## Usage

To use this autoexec, place the contents into your `autoexec.cfg` file located in the `cfg` folder of your TF2 directory. If the file does not exist, create it.

**Example Path:** `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg\autoexec.cfg`

## Features and Settings

### FPS Cap

The FPS cap is set to stabilize the framerate, reducing fluctuations and improving overall gameplay smoothness.

```plaintext
fps_max 150
```

- **Explanation**: Sets the maximum frames per second (FPS) to 150\. This helps stabilize the framerate, making the game smoother and more consistent. It is recommended to set this higher than `cl_cmdrate` to avoid discrepancies between frame generation and server communication.

### Volume

The volume is set to a very low value for users who prefer minimal in-game sounds.

```plaintext
volume 0.001
```

- **Explanation**: Sets the game volume to a very low value. Useful for players who prefer minimal in-game sounds.

### Network Settings

Optimized network settings for better performance and reduced lag.

```plaintext
cl_updaterate 101
cl_cmdrate 101
cl_interp 0
cl_interp_ratio 1
cl_lagcompensation 1
rate 192000
net_graph 1
```

- **cl_updaterate**: Sets the number of updates the client receives from the server per second.
- **cl_cmdrate**: Sets the number of commands the client sends to the server per second.
- **cl_interp**: Sets interpolation amount (0 means minimal interpolation).
- **cl_interp_ratio**: Sets the interpolation ratio (1 means minimal interpolation).
- **cl_lagcompensation**: Enables lag compensation.
- **rate**: Sets the maximum bytes per second the client can receive.
- **net_graph**: Displays network statistics on the screen.

### Keybinds

Custom keybinds for various in-game actions, including communication commands and toggling voice chat.

```plaintext
bind E "+helpme"
bind f "voicemenu 2 7"
bind kp_end "say !items"
bind kp_enter "say_team !^^^!^^^! SPY IN THE AREA !^^^!^^^^!"
bind kp_home "say !glow"
bind kp_plus "say_team *** I have an Uber ready - Who wants it? ***"
bind "kp_ins" "toggle voice_enable 0 1"
bind "kp_multiply" "say !taunt mannr"
bind kp_minus "say_team #!#!# Push up! Sentry Gun DOWN!!! #!#!#!#"
bind kp_pgdn "say !taunt"
bind kp_pgup "say !loadout"
bind kp_uparrow "say !logo"
bind z kill
voice_overdrive 4
voice_scale 1.5
```

- **Explanation**:

  - Binds various keys to specific actions or commands in the game.
  - `voice_overdrive` and `voice_scale` adjust voice chat settings.

### Server Aliases

Aliases for connecting to various Skial servers.

```plaintext
alias skial "connect 91.216.250.11:27015"
alias skial1 "connect 91.216.250.11:27015"
alias skialpayload "connect 91.216.250.11:27015"
// (additional server aliases)
```

- **Explanation**: Creates shortcuts (aliases) for connecting to different servers quickly.

### Threading

r_threaded_client_shadow_manager 1
r_threaded_particles 1
r_threaded_renderables 1
r_fastzreject 1
r_pixelfog 1
