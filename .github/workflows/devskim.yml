# This GitHub Actions workflow is named "DevSkim" and is triggered on pushes and pull requests to the "main" branch,
# as well as on a scheduled cron job that runs every Tuesday at 2:32 AM.
#
# The workflow has read permissions for the contents and includes a single job named "lint" that runs on an Ubuntu 20.04 runner.
# The job has read permissions for actions and contents, and write permissions for security events.
#
# The job consists of the following steps:
# 1. Harden Runner: Uses the step-security/harden-runner action to harden the runner with specific configurations.
# 2. Checkout code: Uses the actions/checkout action to check out the repository's code.
# 3. Run DevSkim scanner: Uses the microsoft/DevSkim-Action to run the DevSkim security scanner.
# 4. Upload DevSkim scan results to GitHub Security tab: Uses the github/codeql-action/upload-sarif action to upload the DevSkim scan results in SARIF format to the GitHub Security tab.
#
# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.
