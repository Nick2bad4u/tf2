# This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to periodically scan for vulnerabilities using OSV-Scanner.
# It performs scans on pull requests, merge groups, scheduled events, and pushes to the main branch.
#
# Workflow Name: OSV-Scanner
#
# Triggers:
# - pull_request: Triggers when a pull request is made to the main branch.
# - merge_group: Triggers when a merge group is created for the main branch.
# - schedule: Triggers based on a cron schedule (every Monday at 12:39 PM).
# - push: Triggers when code is pushed to the main branch.
#
# Permissions:
# - security-events: write - Required to upload SARIF files to the security tab.
# - contents: read - Required to read commit contents.
# - actions: read - Required to read actions.
#
# Jobs:
# - scan-scheduled: Runs on push or scheduled events. Uses a reusable workflow from the OSV-Scanner action.
# - scan-pr: Runs on pull request or merge group events. Uses a reusable workflow from the OSV-Scanner action.
#
# Both jobs use custom arguments for the OSV-Scanner:
# - -r: Recursively scan directories.
# - --skip-git: Skip scanning of git-related files.
# - ./: Scan the current directory.
# - --fail-on-vuln=false: Do not fail the workflow if vulnerabilities are found.

# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# A sample workflow which sets up periodic OSV-Scanner scanning for vulnerabilities,
# in addition to a PR check which fails if new vulnerabilities are introduced.
#
# For more examples and options, including how to ignore specific vulnerabilities,
# see https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/github-action/
