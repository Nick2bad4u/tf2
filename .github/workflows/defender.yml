# This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to integrate Microsoft Defender for DevOps into your CI/CD pipeline.
# It runs on the `windows-latest` environment and is triggered by pushes and pull requests to the `main` branch,
# as well as a scheduled cron job that runs every Saturday at 02:16 UTC.
#
# The workflow performs the following steps:
# 1. Harden Runner: Uses the `step-security/harden-runner` action to enhance the security of the runner environment.
# 2. Checkout Code: Uses the `actions/checkout` action to check out the repository's code.
# 3. Setup .NET: Uses the `actions/setup-dotnet` action to install .NET versions 5.0.x and 6.0.x.
# 4. Run Microsoft Security DevOps: Uses the `microsoft/security-devops-action` to run security and compliance tools.
# 5. Upload Results: Uses the `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif` action to upload the SARIF results to the Security tab in GitHub.
#
# Note: This workflow does not automatically integrate your GitHub organization with Microsoft Defender for DevOps.
# You must create an integration and provide the necessary permissions for reporting data back to Azure.
# For more information, refer to the official documentation:

# Microsoft Security DevOps (MSDO) is a command line application which integrates static analysis tools into the development cycle.
# MSDO installs, configures and runs the latest versions of static analysis tools
# (including, but not limited to, SDL/security and compliance tools).
#
# The Microsoft Security DevOps action is currently in beta and runs on the windows-latest queue,
# as well as Windows self hosted agents. ubuntu-latest support coming soon.
