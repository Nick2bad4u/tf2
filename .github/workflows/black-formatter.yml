# This GitHub Actions workflow is named "black-formatter" and is triggered on push and pull request events.
# It has read permissions for repository contents.
#
# The workflow defines a single job named "black-linter" that runs on the latest Ubuntu runner.
#
# Steps:
# 1. Harden Runner:
#    - Uses the "step-security/harden-runner" action (specific commit) to enhance security.
#    - Disables sudo, blocks egress traffic, and allows specific endpoints (files.pythonhosted.org, github.com, pypi.org).
#
# 2. Checkout Code:
#    - Uses the "actions/checkout" action (specific commit) to check out the repository code.
#
# 3. Run Black Formatter:
#    - Uses the "psf/black" action (specific commit) to run the Black code formatter on the repository.
